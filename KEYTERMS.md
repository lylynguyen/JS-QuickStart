| Angular Concepts       | Description |
| ------------- |:---------------------------|
| Template      | HTML with additional markup |
| Directive     | extend HTML with custom attributes and elements     |
| Model | the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts |
| Scope | context where the model is stored so that the controllers, directives and expressions can access it  |
| Expressions | access variables and functions from the scope |
| Compiler | parses the template and instantiates directives and expressions |
| Filter | formats the value of an expression for display to the user |
| View | what the user sees (the DOM) |
| Data Binding | sync data between the model and the view |
| Controller | the business logic behind views |
| Dependency Injection | Creates and wires objects and functions |
| Injector | dependency injection container |
| Module | a container for the different parts of an app including controllers, services, filters, directives which configures the Injecctor |
| Service | reusable business logic independent of views |

| Git Concepts       | Description | commands |
| ------------- |:---------------------------|:-----:|
| Branch      | a branch is a parallel version or copy of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or `master` branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes. | `git branch`|
| Clone | a copy of a repository that lives on your computer | `git clone` or ![clone](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/clone-repo-clone-url-button.png) ![clone](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/https-url-clone.png)|
| Collaborator | A person with read and write access to a repository |
| Commit | is an individual change to a file (or set of files). Everytime this is done, the file(s) is saved, Git creates a unique ID ("SHA") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. | `git commit`|
| Diff | difference in change between two commits, or saved changes. It will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit | `git diff` |
| Fetch | of fetching refers to getting the latest changed from an online repository without merging them in | `git fetch`|
| Fork | is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on you account. A fork allows you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. It remains attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with you changes | *In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.* ![ForK](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)|
| Git | is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. |
| Merge | or merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a Pull Request (which can be thought of as a request to merge) | `git merge`|
| Open Source | software that can be `freely used, modified, and shared (in both modified and unmodified form) by anyone`. The concept of "open source" is often extended beyond software, to represent a philosophy of collaboration in which working materials are made available online for anyone to fork, modify, discuss, and contribute to |
| Organization | are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real-world organizations. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams |
| Private Repository | are repositories that can only be viewed or contributed to by their creator and collaborators the creator specified. |
| Pull | request are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators | `git pull`|
| Push | or push refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as Github.com. For example, if you change something locally, you'd want to then *push* those changes so that others may access them | `git push` |
| Repository | is the most basic element of Github and can be thought of as a project's folder | |
| Upstream | when talking about a branch or a fork, the primary branch on the original repository is often referred to as the "upstream", since that is the main place that other changes will come in from. The branch/fork you are working on is then called the "downstream".| `git remote add upstream` |
